# Lego_made_robot

In this project an autonomous navigated robot was constructed from LEGO and the sensors described below
for the purpose of autonomous navigation inside a labyrinth with avoidance collision and resource
collection.

The robot uses a sonar and two IR sensors placed on its front sides
for collision avoidance. In addition, it uses a low cost camera located in it's front side
for identifying objects in order to localize itself and for identifying resources. Once
the robot identifies a targeted resource, it collects it and delivers it back to a given
location. The robot can navigate and successfully identify
and collect the correct resources.
