# Autonomous_Navigated_Lego_robot

In this project four wheeled differential steering robot was constructed from LEGO and the sensors 
described below for the purpose of navigating autonomously inside a labyrinth will performing collision
avoidance and to collecting resources.

The robot uses a sonar and two IR sensors placed on its front sides for collision avoidance.
In addition, it uses a low cost camera located in it's front side for identifying objects to 
localize itself and for identifying resources. Once the robot identifies a targeted resource,
it collects it and delivers it back to a given location. The robot can navigate and successfully
identify and collect the correct resources.
